Welcome to my website!
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the Bay Area and got a degree in Electrical Engineering from CU Boulder.  These days, I'm a software engineer.  To learn more about my professional interests, check out my <a href="/about">About</a> page.  My favorite hobby is working on my electric bike.  Additionally, I like building FPV drones, 3D priters, and a few software projects of my own.  I'm also obsessed with skiing and travelling!
