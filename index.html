<p>
Welcome to my website!
</p>

<p>
I graduated from CU Boulder in 2012 with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  I was most interested in embedded systems.  After graduating, I became a software developer, writing embedded software at first, and more recently building websites.

My favorite activities are Backcountry Skiing and Mountain Biking.  I'm also interested in Droans, 3D Printing, and Mechanical Keyboards.  I enjoy spending time in Lake Tahoe, and occasionally travelling to cool places.
