Welcome to my website!
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the Bay Area and got a degree in Electrical Engineering from CU Boulder.  These days, I'm a frelance software engineer based out of Himachal Pradesh, India.  My specialities are infrastructure, security, firmware, and OS development.  If you'd like to get in touch, see my <a href="/about.html">about</a> page.
</p>

<p>
During my free time, I build electric bikes, drones, and 3d printers.  I also love backcountry skiing and exploring the Himalayas on moterbike.

<p>
Life is an adventure... Have fun! (0_<)
