title: About
---

I graduated from CU Boulder in 2012 with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a professional certificate in Embedded Systems.  During my education, I developed a keen interest in computers and software.

After graduation, I moved to Silicon Valley, where I've spent time working for both large tech companies and startups.  Through my career, I've developed professional experience related to full stack engineering, payment software, cryptocurrency, operating systems, and machine learning.

I'm always interested in connecting with like-minded people to collaborate with.  If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me using any of the platforms below:
